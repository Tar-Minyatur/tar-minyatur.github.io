{"name":"Tar-Minyatur @ GitHub","tagline":"A random coder's playground","body":"# About me\r\n\r\nI'm not a heavy GitHub user yet, but I really like it and I'm trying to make more use of it. Being employed and thus working on projects unfit for being published on GitHub, my time to gain experience here is limited. I've been a programmer for quite some time now, mainly focused on **PHP** and web development technologies for a long time, and in the last couple of years I concentrated more and more on **Java** application development.\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n\r\nAs I said, currently there is not a lot of exciting stuff to see here. I'm merely experimenting with GitHub and testing its capabilities to find out how it could help me be more effective. Some things you might be interested in are:\r\n\r\n- [**WorkTracker**](http://github.com/Tar-Minyatur/WorkTracker)  \r\n  Simple, but useful time tracker tool for your daily work. Also kind of a development playground for me.\r\n\r\n- [**LazyCMS**](http://github.com/Tar-Minyatur/LazyCMS)  \r\n  Light-weight content management system with static file rendering.\r\n\r\n- [**Tools**](http://tar-minyatur.github.io/Tools/)  \r\n  A collection of small tools I wrote for fun or because I really wanted them to be the way I wrote them.\r\n\r\n- [**Code Snippets**](https://github.com/Tar-Minyatur/CodeSnippets)  \r\n  Some random code snippets written in different languages.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
